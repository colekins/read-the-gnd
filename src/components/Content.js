    <p>
      Recognizing the duty of the Federal Government to create a Green New Deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereas the October 2018 report entitled “Special Report on Global Warming
      of 1.5 ºC” by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the
      November 2018 Fourth National Climate Assessment report found that—
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        human activity is the dominant cause of observed climate change over the
        past century;
      </li>
      <li>
        a changing climate is causing sea levels to rise and an increase in
        wildfires, severe storms, droughts, and other extreme weather events
        that threaten human life, healthy communities, and critical
        infrastructure;
      </li>
      <li>
        global warming at or above 2 degrees Celsius beyond preindustrialized
        levels will cause—
        <ol type='a'>
          <li>
            mass migration from the regions most affected by climate change;
          </li>
          <li>
            more than $500,000,000,000 in lost annual economic output in the
            United States by the year 2100;
          </li>
          <li>
            wildfires that, by 2050, will annually burn at least twice as much
            forest area in the western United States than was typically burned
            by wildfires in the years preceding 2019;
          </li>
          <li>a loss of more than 99 percent of all coral reefs on Earth;</li>
          <li>
            more than 350,000,000 more people to be exposed globally to deadly
            heat stress by 2050; and
          </li>
          <li>
            a risk of damage to $1,000,000,000,000 of public infrastructure and
            coastal real estate in the United States; and
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        global temperatures must be kept below 1.5 degrees Celsius above
        preindustrialized levels to avoid the most severe impacts of a changing
        climate, which will require—
        <ol type='a'>
          <li>
            global reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from human sources of
            40 to 60 percent from 2010 levels by 2030; and
          </li>
          <li>net-zero global emissions by 2050;</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Whereas, because the United States has historically been responsible for a
      disproportionate amount of greenhouse gas emissions, having emitted 20
      percent of global greenhouse gas emissions through 2014, and has a high
      technological capacity, the United States must take a leading role in
      reducing emissions through economic transformation;
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereas the United States is currently experiencing several related
      crises, with—
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        life expectancy declining while basic needs, such as clean air, clean
        water, healthy food, and adequate health care, housing, transportation,
        and education, are inaccessible to a significant portion of the United
        States population;
      </li>
      <li>
        a 4-decade trend of wage stagnation, deindustrialization, and antilabor
        policies that has led to—
        <ol type='a'>
          <li>
            hourly wages overall stagnating since the 1970s despite increased
            worker productivity;
          </li>
          <li>
            the third-worst level of socioeconomic mobility in the developed
            world before the Great Recession;
          </li>
          <li>
            the erosion of the earning and bargaining power of workers in the
            United States; and
          </li>
          <li>
            {' '}
            inadequate resources for public sector workers to confront the
            challenges of climate change at local, State, and Federal levels;
            and
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        the greatest income inequality since the 1920s, with—
        <ol type='a'>
          <li>
            the top 1 percent of earners accruing 91 percent of gains in the
            first few years of economic recovery after the Great Recession;
          </li>
          <li>
            a large racial wealth divide amounting to a difference of 20 times
            more wealth between the average white family and the average black
            family; and
          </li>
          <li>
            a gender earnings gap that results in women earning approximately 80
            percent as much as men, at the median;
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Whereas climate change, pollution, and environmental destruction have
      exacerbated systemic racial, regional, social, environmental, and economic
      injustices (referred to in this preamble as “systemic injustices”) by
      disproportionately affecting indigenous peoples, communities of color,
      migrant communities, deindustrialized communities, depopulated rural
      communities, the poor, low-income workers, women, the elderly, the
      unhoused, people with disabilities, and youth (referred to in this
      preamble as “frontline and vulnerable communities”);
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereas, climate change constitutes a direct threat to the national
      security of the United States—
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        by impacting the economic, environmental, and social stability of
        countries and communities around the world; and
      </li>
      <li>by acting as a threat multiplier;</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Whereas the Federal Government-led mobilizations during World War II and
      the New Deal created the greatest middle class that the United States has
      ever seen, but many members of frontline and vulnerable communities were
      excluded from many of the economic and societal benefits of those
      mobilizations; and
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereas the House of Representatives recognizes that a new national,
      social, industrial, and economic mobilization on a scale not seen since
      World War II and the New Deal era is a historic opportunity—
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li> to create millions of good, high-wage jobs in the United States;</li>
      <li>
        to provide unprecedented levels of prosperity and economic security for
        all people of the United States; and
      </li>
      <li>to counteract systemic injustices: Now, therefore, be it</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that—</p>
